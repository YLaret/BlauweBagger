https://www.warp.dev/terminus/sudo-chown

Each file and directory belongs to a user and a group. Default is root
pi user is (no longer) the root user. So if you want permissions/ownership to certain folder you have to set those permissions
This can be down using chmod and chown. chmod will be gone after reboot and chown is permanent.

!!!!!!chown can break your system!!!!!!

home folder is usually accessible by the pi user
docker-volumes is not for example. So if you want to run a python venv inside this folder you will need to gain ownership (or be part of the group)
$sudo chown pi:pi -R /docker-volumes
$sudo chown <user>:<group> -R /docker-volumes

if you wanna check main folders permissions:
ls -l /
on the left it shows user and on the right group


##########################Docker Device permission Error nr 13##########################################
When you are not able to acces a device outside the container, for example "/dev/ttyUSB0" you should add the device to the docker compose file.
$  devices:
     - /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0

If it still doesn't work you can add a <user> to the docker compose file with the rights to the correct groups.
Setting "user:root" will solve the issue
$ user:root #This is a preferred method over privileged

A better solution is to add the "containers user" to the group that owns/manages the device instead of using "root"
This can be done by adding the following code to the docker compose file
$ group_add:
     - dialout #for example
     -"46" #numerical version of group, quotes are mandatory

Usually docker wants the numerical version of the group. This number can be different inside the container than outside.
In order find the group number inside the container you must get inside the container on the command/bash line and run the following code:
$ docker exec -it <container> bash
$ ls -ld <path to device>
example output: crw-rw----    1 root     46        188,   0 Apr 24 20:11 /dev/ttyUSB0
root is the user and 46 is the group
Add this group to the compose file and it should work

check in which groups <user> is:
groups <user>

Find group name and owner(user) of folder
ls -ld <path to folder>

Find group name and owner(user) of file
ls -ld <path to file>
example: ls -ld /dev/ttyUSB0

ls -la <path to file>
#does the same but also includes files with . at the beginning (hidden files)
